      <h2>Best Podcasts by Category</h2>
      
      <h3>True Crime</h3>
      <p>
        True crime podcasts continue to dominate in 2026. <strong>Serial</strong> remains the gold standard with its deep 
        investigative journalism, while <strong>My Favorite Murder</strong> and <strong>Crime Junkie</strong> offer different 
        approaches—comedy-infused and concise respectively. These shows prove that true crime can be both respectful and compelling.
      </p>

      <h3>Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
      <p>
        For aspiring entrepreneurs and business enthusiasts, <strong>How I Built This</strong> by Guy Raz offers unparalleled 
        insights into the stories behind successful companies. <strong>The Tim Ferriss Show</strong> deconstructs world-class 
        performers to extract actionable tactics you can apply immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Health & Wellness</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Huberman Lab</strong> has revolutionized health podcasting with science-backed protocols for sleep, focus, and 
        performance. Dr. Andrew Huberman's ability to make neuroscience accessible has made it one of the most popular podcasts 
        of 2026. For longevity-focused listeners, <strong>The Peter Attia Drive</strong> offers deep dives into metabolic health.
      </p>

      <h3>Comedy</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend</strong> and <strong>SmartLess</strong> prove that celebrity podcasts can be 
        genuinely funny and insightful. The unscripted nature of these conversations creates authentic moments you won't find 
        in traditional media.
